To estimate the power consumption of an RTX 4090 GPU if it were built using technology similar to the ENIAC, we need to consider the power consumption of the ENIAC, the power trends in computing, and the power efficiency improvements over time.

1. Power consumption of the ENIAC:
The ENIAC, one of the earliest electronic general-purpose computers, was built in the 1940s. It consumed around 150 kW of power.

2. Power trend in computing:
Over the years, the power efficiency of computing components has significantly improved. Modern GPUs like the RTX 4090 are designed to be power-efficient while delivering high performance. The RTX 4090, based on current technology, is estimated to have a power consumption of around 400-500 watts.

3. Estimating power consumption with similar technology:
If we assume that the power efficiency of the RTX 4090 using ENIAC-era technology would be similar to the ENIAC, then the power consumption of the RTX 4090 would be around 150 kW. This is a rough estimate based on the power consumption of the ENIAC.

4. Approximate land needed to house the computer:
The ENIAC, being one of the earliest computers, was a massive machine occupying a significant amount of space. It filled a room of about 1,800 square feet (167 square meters). If we assume that the RTX 4090 built using similar technology to the ENIAC would require a similar level of space efficiency, we can estimate that it would also need a comparable amount of space, around 1,800 square feet.

In summary:
- Estimated power consumption of an RTX 4090 built with ENIAC-era technology: around 150 kW
- Approximate land needed to house the computer: around 1,800 square feet

Please note that these are rough estimates based on the information available and assumptions made about power efficiency and space requirements. Actual values could vary significantly based on specific design choices and technological constraints.
