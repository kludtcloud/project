**main.py is the main function. The other .py are non production or legacy implementation
        **wsgi is the gate way config flask between Gunicorn and Flask
        **gunicorn.service is creating a base service in the systemd/system file, that you can enable on start etc.
            gunicorn binds the running flask app in the backend to a proxy socket "app.sock" in the "/var/www/app"
                in this case.

        "kludtcloud.com.conf" Nginx webserver front end config file for the "/etc/nginx/sites-avalible"
                linked to sites-enabaled.
                this allows the incomming :80 requests to pull/be forwarded the flask proxy through the socket
